Drawing is a powerful tool for communicating concepts in visual form --- a few well-placed strokes can convey the identity of a person, object, or scene. Prior work has found that deep neural network models of the ventral stream trained purely on photographs also recognized drawings by nonexpert adults, reflecting concordance in abstract representations of object categories in drawings and photos at higher layers in these models (Fan, Yamins, & Turk-Browne, 2015). How do ordinary people become so effective at producing recognizable drawings? Here we examine the trajectory of this learning during childhood. Children (N = 41, M = 7.15 years, range 4-10 years) participated in an iPad-based drawing game. On each round, they were prompted with a verbal cue to draw one of sixteen familiar objects (e.g., “Can you draw a cup?”). Children drew each object category for 30 seconds, after which they were prompted to either make another drawing or to stop drawing altogether. Afterwards, a group of naive adults (N = 15) were presented with each of the children's drawings and guessed the identity of the drawn object. Using a linear mixed-effect modeling approach, we found that recognizability of drawings increased reliably with age (XXXX), accounting for variation across categories and children, and after controlling for the amount of time spent drawing, number of strokes, and total ink used (% drawings recognized; chance = 4.8%; M4yrs = 16.5%, M5yrs = 46%, M6yrs= 71%, M7yrs = 71.5%, M8yrs = 66.2%, M9yrs = 75%, M10yrs = 84.2%); removing age from the model significantly decreased the fit (X2(1) = 21.93, p = 3e-06). These results suggest that the capacity to quickly produce graphical representations that communicate object category information is highly developed by middle childhood. More broadly, these findings point to visual production tasks as a promising avenue for examining the development of object category representations.

In order to draw a “chair”, we need both to access a mental representation of this category and distill this representation into a the few strokes of a pen. These visual abstractions capture ‘high-level’ perceptual similarity relationships between object categories (Fan, Yamins, & Turk-Brown, 2015), depicting the key perceptual features needed to convey category membership. Here, we examine when children develop the ability to quickly produce these abstract visual representations. Children (N = 41, M = 7.15 years, range 4-10 years) participated in a drawing game on an iPad where they were prompted to draw one of sixteen object categories with a verbal cue (e.g., “Can you draw a cup?”). Children drew each object category for 30 seconds, after which they were prompted to either make another drawing or to stop drawing altogether. Afterwards, a group of adults (N = 15) were shown all 286 drawings and attempted to recognize each drawing by choosing between the original 16 object categories and 6 additional foil categories. We asked whether the recognizability of drawings increased with age by fitting linear mixed-effect models. We found that this was the case, despite a wide degree of variation across object categories and by individual children, and when accounting for the amount of time spent drawing, number of strokes, and ink used (% drawings recognized; chance = 4.8%; M4yrs = 16.5%, M5yrs = 46%, M6yrs= 71%, M7yrs = 71.5%, M8yrs = 66.2%, M9yrs = 75%, M10yrs = 84.2%); removing age from the model significantly decreased the fit (X2(1) = 21.93, p = 3e-06).These results suggest that by middle childhood we develop the ability to quickly produce visual abstractions that efficiently convey object category information, and broadly point towards visual production as a new avenue for examining the development of object category representations.
