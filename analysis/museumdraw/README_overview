KidDraw
Preprocessing pipeline overview
11/25/2017

1. Drawings are pulled from the database on the cocolab server. Basic descriptives (number of strokes, intensity, etc.) are calculated in python in an iPython notebook  (pythonNotebook/looking_at_drawings.ipynb) and read out to a .csv file ('preprocessed_data/museumdraw_E1c_imageData.csv'). All sketches are saved here locally and pushed to github repo (under sketches). 

2. Turk recognition ratings were obtained for all drawings as of this Tuesday (11/21, 286 drawings). Code and preprocessing for these rating data (N=14 turkers did all 286 ratings) is under ratings/recognition_ratings. Analysis code reads in the json files and outputs a nice .csv file, which I've copied to the anlaysis foler ('preprocessed_data/museumdraw_E1c_recognitionData.csv')

3. These data from these two .csv files are read into the anlaysis file here (analysis1_nov25_vssAbstract.Rmd), where all of the descriptives and statistics are computed and fed into the VSS abstract at the end of the document.
