## true positive: pixel was tracing shape & drawer traced there: number of pixels that overlapped (HITS)
## false positive: pixel was not tracing shape & drawer traced there: number of pixels that were drawn NOT on the shape (false alarms)
## true negative; pixel was NOT tracing shape & drawer DID not draw there (white pixels outside of tracing shape) (correct rejections)
## false negatives: pixel WAS the tracing shape & drawer DID NOT tracer there: number of pixels that should have been traced and were not (MISS)


precision: tp / tp + fp  -- Proportion of your drawing that was on the shape
recall: tp / tp + fn -- Proportion of the the shape that you got your drawing on
F = 2 * (precision*recall) / (precision+recall)
