Failure in planning can lead to exaggerated features [freeman 1980,Thomas and Tsalimi (1988)]

"They also discovered that many “errors” appearing in children's drawings (e.g., transparencies, capsizements, differences in size, etc.) were actually problem solving solutions that the young artists had adopted to overcome the limitations of representing three-dimensional reality on a two-dimensional surface (Anning and Ring, 2004, Arnheim, 1954, Freeman, 1980, Matthews, 2003)."



Indeed, we suspect that there are likely to be large individual differences in children's ability to draw that may covary with other cultural or societal factors. there are likely to be large individual and cultural differences in how children draw,


In fact, while drawings behaviors have been using as a way to measure children's opinions about social groups [refs], their cognitive abilities {XX} or XX, relatively little work has sought to quantify the changes in the drawings themseves. Those that have done so have focused largely on the emergence of figurative drawings in the preschool years [cite fenson], documenting the immensive changes within an individual child. Here we take the opposite approach -- we seek to create a large-scale, cross-sectional, naturlaitic database of drwaing behaviors with the hopes of anlayzing both the consistency and variability in children's drawings. Indeed, we suspect that there are likely to be large individual differences in children's ability to draw that may covary with other cultural or societal factors. there are likely to be large individual and cultural differences in how children draw, 


conclusions about how children express what they know via drawings have typically come from small-scale laboratory or observational studies. Furthermore, fine-motor control abilities develop dramatically throughout this chilhood, perhaps explaining many observed developmental changes [] Here, we create a large-scale, cross-sectional database of children's drawings of object categories to anlayzing both the consistency and variability in children's drawings across chilhoo



cognitive development in particular  [@piaget1929child] as well as representational change throughout childhood [@karmiloff1990constraints].
